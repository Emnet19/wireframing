# Wireframing  

## Introduction  
**Wireframing** is the process of creating a skeletal framework or blueprint of a website or application. It represents the basic structure, layout, and placement of elements on a page without focusing on colors, images, or final design details.  

Wireframes are typically used in the early stages of the design process to visualize how users will interact with the system. They allow designers, developers, and stakeholders to collaborate and refine ideas before moving into high-fidelity design or coding.  

## Importance of Wireframing  
- **Clarity of Structure** – Wireframes provide a clear outline of the layout and user flow.  
- **Early Feedback** – Helps stakeholders understand and validate the concept before development begins.  
- **Cost and Time Efficiency** – Making changes at the wireframing stage is much easier and less expensive compared to later stages.  
- **Improved Communication** – Acts as a communication tool among designers, developers, and clients.  
- **Foundation for Design** – Serves as the starting point for high-fidelity designs and development.  

In short, wireframing is an essential step that bridges abstract ideas with tangible designs, ensuring that the final product meets both user needs and business objectives.
